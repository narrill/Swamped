# Swamped Engine
A proof-of-concept for a game and graphics engine. Currently it just spawns a bunch of cones and cubes and a bunch of particles. If a cone touches a cube both are destroyed; cone-cone and cube-cube collisions are not checked.

WASD for movement, right-click for mouselook, B toggles bloom, and L toggles FXAA.
